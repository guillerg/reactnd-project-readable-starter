# Readable API Server

Developed by Udacity for the React Nanodegree, this is the backend API Server used to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project. Original repo is here: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git

## Server application: Installation

Clone project from github: run `git clone https://github.com/guillerg/reactnd-project-readable-starter`
- `npm install` to install packages
- `node server` to run on port 5001 unless modified in `config.js`

## Client application: Installation

1. Unless already done, run `git clone https://github.com/guillerg/reactnd-project-readable-starter` to clone project
2. `cd client` and run `npm install`
3. `npm start` should open a browser to http://localhost:3000/
